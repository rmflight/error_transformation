In many -omics analyses, a primary step is data transformation. A transformation
is generally employed to transform non-IID, proportional error (variance) to IID
additive error, that most statistical methods appropriately handle. However, 
-omics data frequently contain error sources that result in both additive and 
proportional errors. To our knowledge, there has not been a systematic study on
detecting proportional error, or the effect of transformations on the error 
structure. In this work we demonstrate that graphing simple summaries of the
data allow the detection of proportional error in data, and conveniently show
the effect of various transformations on the error structure as well. We also
find that the log-transform is the most effective method for removing
proportional error.
